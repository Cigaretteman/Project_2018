        <hr>
		<p>This section documents information regarding Aquaponics and the benefits it provides
			in conjunction with Hydroponics. The information is supplied in support of establishing an Aquaponics division inside of the DKAL main facility.</p>

		  <h1>Defining Aquaponics</h1>
		  <hr>
		  <p><strong>Aquaponics</strong>is conventionally a system of sheltered environments for fish and other aquatic animals.
			  It is used to extract nutrients from the waste produced by these creatures. The nutrients can be used for various
			  purposes, but their most common use is to support the self-sufficenty of Hydroponics.
		  </p>
		  <h1>Supplementing Hydroponics</h1>
		  <hr>
		  <p>Aquaponics is a closed loop system which allows growing fish and plants together with high self-sufficency.</p>
		  <br />
		  <h1>Process</h1>
		  <br />
		  <p class="Process">Water from a fish tank is pumped into a flood tank, where the ammonia-rich waste produced by the fish is .
			  properly mixed. This fertiliser serves as a source of nutrients for the plants stacked over the fish tank.
			The grow beds, where the plants are raised, have a thin layer of soil to support the root system. 
			  Once the nutrients are consumed from the water, this water is drip-fed into the fish tank to maintain its water levels.
				The recycling process of aquaponics improves hydroponics self-sufficiency and removes the need for 
			  additional resources to aid plant growth.</p>
