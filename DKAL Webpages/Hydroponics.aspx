	<h2>1. What is Hydroponics?</h2>

	<p>
		Hydroponics has been around for decades. It was originally developed by Nasa around the 
		50's / 60's as a way to feed astronauts on deep space missions and moon missions. 
		Since then, it has been picked up by those wanting to optimize growing techniques. 
		Not the hippies though, they think soil is pure and all that nonsense. 
		Over the past fifteen years, has greatly picked up commercial uses. 
		As a personal endevour - it's still highly associated with weed. 
		Going to the hydroponics section of the garden center, is typically separate from 
		the rest of the building, with heavy doors and bars. There is 
		a large underground culture surrounding it. Which is unfortunate.

	</p>
	<br>
	<p>There are several variations on the theme of Hydroponics, however the overall concept involves a soilless
		growing method that present to the plant, all nutrient required for growth.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>Of the methods, they all have pros and cons, however the method most used commercially is Deep Water Culture (DWC).</p>
