		 <div class="panel-heading"><h2>Walking as a physical fitness</h2>
		 <p>
		 Walking is currently the most popular form of physical activity in the world. 
		 Walking is one of the least expensive and most broadly accessible forms of physical activity. 
		 It is rarely associated with physical injury and can easily be adopted by people of all ages, 
		 including those who have never participated in physical activity. 
		 Studies have shown that walking has higher levels of adherence than other forms of physical activity, 
		 possibly because it is convenient and overcomes many of the commonly perceived barriers to physical activity: 
		 lack of time, lack of fitness or lack of skill.

        <div class="panel-heading"><h2>Walking for 30 minutes a day</h2>
		 <p>
		To get the health benefits, try to walk for at least 30 minutes as briskly as possible on most days of the week. 
		‘Brisk’ means that anyone can still talk but not sing and may be puffing slightly. 
		Moderate activities such as walking pose little health risk but, if  have any medical condition, 
		check with doctor before starting any new exercise program of physical activity.
