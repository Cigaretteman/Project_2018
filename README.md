## Solar power
### Introduction
The solar power is the one of the most popular alternative energy system among the alternative energy sources, especially in the residential market.

### History of Solar power
The solar technologies starting in 1860s, and only 1% efficient cells. When global warming concerns became big issue in the mid 1990s, the solar power became so popular. Also, the solar panel efficiency gets increasing. EnergySage(n.d.) mention that 2017, prototype for solar cell capable of 44.5% efficiency now. In other words, the solar panel cost over time is decreased. In 2008, the cost of solar panel installation was $8.82 per watt, but as see the table, now $3.14 per watt.

### Applied in Canadian residential market
According to Solarpanelpower(2018), Saskatchewan is the best province for applied solar powers.

In Canada, most of province support the solar power installation for the individual household. The rebates, tax credits, and more. In nutshell, you do not need to pay anything for solar power installation.
In addition, for the residential use, roof mount is the easiest way. You may able to install the ground mount, but you need to get special permit.

### Conclusion
The solar energy may not the best solution for alternative energy, yet easiest way of using the alternative energy and the technology gets better over time. The fossil fuel is not infinite, but The Sun is almost infinite and it does not cause the global warming as much as fossil fuel. 
Alternative energy is not the option anymore, we should more applied in our life for long term future.
