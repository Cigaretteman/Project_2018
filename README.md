  - Byounghyun Oh - Solar power
  - Riley Miller - Wind farms
  
### Procedures, Processes, Menus, Layout
Our initial process was to [narrow down the scope of our project to one or two different sources of energy](https://github.com/ConfederationC/Project_2018/issues/33). 
We started by researching 11 different forms of energy from [RenewableResourceCollation.org](http://renewableresourcescoalition.org/), and then made decisions about which forms would be most appropriate for the scope of the project. Once we had [refined our scope down to 3 different energy systems](https://github.com/ConfederationC/Project_2018/issues/33): solar, hydroelectric, and wind we decided to cut hydroelectric, as that is standard in the Thunder Bay region. 


### Decisions and Justifications
#### Options considered
|Energy Option|Short Description|Decision|
|---|---|---|
|Solar Energy|Light and heat from the sun is absorbed as energy, harnessed and stored.|:heavy_check_mark:|
|Wind Power|Harnessrd airflow as mechanical power to turn electric generators.|:heavy_check_mark:|
|Hydrogen Fuel|A clean burning fuel derived from natural gas,  fossil fuel. Hydogen is high in energy. A engine which burns pure hydrogen produces _almost no_ pollution. *Used by NASA in rockets since the 1970s.|:x:|
|Tidal Energy|Tidal energy is yielded from water, similar concept to wind turbines.|:x:|
|Biomass Energy|Organic material from plants and animals is burned, releasing power. |:x:|
|Geothermal Power|Vent down into steam/hot water reservoirs underground, harness it to drive an electrical generator. [[1]](http://www.alliantenergykids.com/EnergyandTheEnvironment/RenewableEnergy/022401) Is a sustainable, renewable source of heat and energy.|:x:|
|Natural Gas| Igniting natural gas to create pressure as a mechanical power to turn electric generators|:x:|
|Biofuels|Organic materials like wood and fossil fuels are are used to generate electricity|:x:|
|Wave Energy| Renewable source of energy from ocean waves that generate electricity |:x:|
|Hydroelectric Energy| Using running water to turn electric generators |:x:|
|Nuclear Power| Fissionable elements that produce radiate energy and can bw converted to usable electricity |:x:|

#### Reasoning
**Solar energy** was chosen because...

**Wind power** was chosen because wind turbines are a *clean and renewable* source of energy, are relatively cheap compared to other alternative forms of energy, and could be implemented in Thunder Bay. In 2007, Horizon Wind Inc had planned to spend $75 million bringing 30 wind turbines to Thunder Bay, but scrapped the project in 2014.

## Solar power
### Introduction
The solar power is the one of the most popular alternative energy system among the alternative energy sources, especially in the residential market.

### History of Solar power
The solar technologies starting in 1860s, and only the 1% efficient cells. When global warming concerns became big issue in the mid 1990s, the solar power became so popular. Also, the solar panel efficiency gets increasing. EnergySage(n.d.) mention that 2017, prototype for solar cell capable of 44.5% efficiency now. In other words, the solar panel cost over time is decreased. In 2008, the cost of solar panel installation was $8.82 per watt, but as see the table, now $3.14 per watt.

### Applied in Canadian residential market
According to Solarpanelpower(2018), Saskatchewan is the best province for applied solar powers.

In Canada, most of province support the solar power installation for the individual household. The rebates, tax credits, and more. In nutshell, you do not need to pay anything for solar power installation.
In addition, for the residential use, roof mount is the easiest way. You may able to install the ground mount, but you need to get special permit.

### Conclusion
The solar energy may not the best solution for alternative energy, yet easiest way of using the alternative energy and the technology gets better over time. The fossil fuel is not infinite, but The Sun is almost infinite and it does not cause the global warming as much as fossil fuel. 
Alternative energy is not the option anymore, we should more applied in our life for long term future.

## Wind farms
### Introduction
A wind farm or wind park is a collection of wind turbines used to produce electricity. Nationwide, an increase of wind electricity generated rose 1.3% in 2015 compared to 2013.

#### Pricing
According to Windustry, the cost of commercial wind turbines "range from about 1.3 million to $2.2 million per MW (1,000,000 watts) of nameplate capacity installed." Alternatively, for residential power "wind turbines under 100 kilowatts cost roughly $3,000 to $8,000 per kilowatt of capacity." [[1]](http://www.windustry.org/how_much_do_wind_turbines_cost)

#### Area
According to SaskWind, wind turbines must be spread out over several hundred meters so "the turblent wake of one does not interfere with another." [[1]](https://www.saskwind.ca/land-area/) Wind turbines require a constant uninterrupted flow of wind.  

### Conclusion
The solar energy may not the best solution for alternative energy, yet easiest way of using the alternative energy and the technology gets better over time. The fossil fuel is not infinite, but The Sun is almost infinite and it does not cause the global warming as much as fossil fuel. 
Alternative energy is not the option anymore, we should more applied in our life for long term future.
