**1. What is Hyrdroponics?**
Hydroponics has been around for decades. It was originally developed by Nasa around the 50's / 60's as a way to feed astronauts on deep space missions and moon missions. Since then, it has been picked up by those wanting to optimize growing techniques. Not the hippies though, they think soil is pure and all that nonsense. Over the past fifteen years, has greatly picked up commercial uses. As a personal endevour - it's still highly associated with weed. Going to the hydroponics section of the garden center, is typically separate from the rest of the building, with heavy doors and bars. There is a large underground culture surrounding it. Which is unfortunate. 

There are several variations on the theme of Hyrdoponics, however the overall concept involves a soilless growing method that presents to the plant, all nutrient required for growth. 

Of the methods, they all have pros and cons, however the method most used commercially is Deep Water Culture (DWC).

This method uses net pots to hold a growing medium. Typically this can be rockwool or cotton, surrounded by expanded clay. Commercial setups try to reduce labour as much as possible since tens of thousands of plants can be grown in a small area. 

**2. Advantages / Disadvantages**

The main advantage to this method is simplicity. Plants are suspended on a floating medium or lid, above the water containing nutrients. Water just touches the bottom of the net pots, allowing the roots to grow into the solution.

In order to prevent root rot and issues with anerobic bacteria, the solution must be continously aerated using compressors and air stones. Similar to fish tanks, depending on the scale of the operation. 

Because the plants are presented with ideal water and nutrient levels, the roots grow only to a fraction of what they would in soil.  This allows plants to be tightly packed together, which in a soil growing situation, would be impossible.

Blair Cox has used hydroponics for several years in personal gardens. Also an interesting attempt at aquaponics that resulted in a most epic fail.
